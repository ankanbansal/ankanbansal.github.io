<h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
</div>
<h2>Quizzing</h2>
<p>I was an active member of the Quiz Club at IIT Kanpur. I have participated in many quizzes at IIT Kanpur and 
outside and have won a few of them. Some friends and I have started a new quizzing hobby group at UMD too. </p>
<h2>Student Festivals, IIT Kanpur</h2>
<p>I was coordinator of <i>Crypto</i> (an online cryptography treasure hunt) in Techkriti&rsquo;12, the technical festival of 
IIT Kanpur. I was responsible for making and conducting the whole event which saw a participation of thousands of 
people from all over the country. I was also coordinator of the Quiz Events in Antaragni&rsquo;12, the cultural festival 
of IIT Kanpur, where I was responsible for organising the event in 5 different cities around India.</p>
<h2>Counselling Service, IIT Kanpur</h2>
<p>As a <i>Link Student</i> with the counselling service, I helped academically deficient students through individual 
tutoring and mentoring. I was a <i>Student Guide</i> and worked with a large team conducting the orientation programme 
of the freshers to help them acclimatise to the new environment. </p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I read. I particularly enjoy the fantasy genre. I also read some history. But my favourite book till now has been 
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> by Alexandre Dumas. Some of the books I have read or want to read can be found 
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25100820-ankan-bansal">here</a>. </p>
<p>I watch movies too. My favourite movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/"><i>Children of Men</i></a>, though 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/"><i>The Man from Earth</i></a> is a close second.</p>
<p>Recently I have started teaching myself to play the violin.</p>
